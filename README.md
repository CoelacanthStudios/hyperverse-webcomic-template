# Hyperverse Webcomic Template
### A simple and dynamic PHP webcomic template.
---

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=17106861" data-patreon-widget-type="become-patron-button"><img alt="become a patron" src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" height="35px"></a>

A working example of this template is my webcomic which I made this template from.

[Here's a link to my webcomic so you can see what this template looks like.](https://hyperve.rs/)

This template is almost entirely automatically managed, all you have to do is customize the settings file `/settings.php` to your liking and copy the last page folder and change the caption.

The default favicon directory is `/icns/favicon.png`, this can be edited in `/dynamic/php/head.php`
