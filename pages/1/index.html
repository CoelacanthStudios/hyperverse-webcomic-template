<!-- 
	Ok, some quick notes about how all this works.
	The $pubDate variable is how the RSS feed and the page log get the date each page was published.
 -->
<?php $pubdate = 'Mon, 4 Feb 2019 04:56 EST'?>

<!-- 
	You can name the images whatever you want but be consistent so the metadata tags can find the image.
	Of course there is an option in the settings.php file so you can set what the first panel is named.
 -->
<?='<img class="panel" src="/' . $pageFolder . '/' . $page . '/panel1.jpg">'?>
<!-- <img class="panel" src="panel1.jpg"> -->

<!-- 
	This is the caption, pretty obvious what it's used for.
 -->
<div class="caption">
	There once was a dog named Scrungus.<br>
	And one day he ate some fungus.<br>
	Then he got really thin, found this jacket in a bin,<br>
	And then found happiness in abundance.
</div>

<!-- 
	This is what the next button text will be set to, if you need to use an apostrophe you'll need to escape it by using a backslash.
	For example, to have the next button be "Let's go eat" set $nextButton to 'Let\'s go eat' or use quotes like so "Let's gp eat" either way works.
	Important to note: the next button only appears on the page when the next page exists.
 -->
<?php $nextButton = 'chungo spungo'?>

<!-- 
	That should be all you need to know about how this works, you just need to copy this file over to the next page and probably delete these comments.
	Good luck making your comic and have fun!
